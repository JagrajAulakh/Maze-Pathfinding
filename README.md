# Maze Path-finding Simulation

#### What is this about?
This project is a basic simulation of a path-finding algorithm.
The program will create a randomly generated maze and find the best path from point A -> point B (picked by the user).

### What did we use?
- Java swing for graphics
- A* algorithm for path-finding
- [] for maze generation

### Controls
There are 2 modes (`m` to switch modes):
- Point mode
    - `LMB` places start point
    - `RMB` places end point
- Maze mode
    - `LMB` draws walls
    - `RMB` removes walls
